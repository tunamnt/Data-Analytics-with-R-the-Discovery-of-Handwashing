# Data Analysis with R-the-Discovery-of-Handwashing

With the application of R language, I examine the clinic-level data published by Dr. Semmelweis in 1859 in which he compared maternal mortality rates from before and after handwashing was instated. I also look at hospital-level data he analyzed, where he compared mortality rates across two hospitals with different autopsy practices.

Research questions are as follows:

1. What were the death rates for each year in the both datasets? 
To answer this question, I add a death_rate column to both the clinic_data and the hospital_data which is calculated by dividing deaths by births.

2. In each clinic, what was the average death rate for the years before handwashing was introduced in 1847? 

3. What were the average death rates in the Vienna General Hospital both before and after pathological autopsies were introduced in 1823?
